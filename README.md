# SpaceInvadersGame
A simple 2D Space Invaders style game game using Java and Slick 2D as part of a University Artificial Inteligence course. The game features a simple AI partner for the player, which uses a combination of Fuzzy Logic and a Naive Bayesian classifier to determine which behaviour mode it should operate in.
