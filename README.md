# SpaceInvadersGame
A simple 2D Space Invaders style game game using Java and the Slick2D library as a project for a University Artificial Inteligence course. The game features a simple AI partner for the player, which uses a combination of Fuzzy Logic and a Naive Bayesian classifier to determine which behaviour mode it should operate in.
